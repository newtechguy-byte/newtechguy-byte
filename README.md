   Hi, I’m @newtechguy-byte
    I’m interested in coding,travel,video games and entrepreneurship
       I’m currently learning Python via  the Solo learner app and I plan to start my own freelance business in a year or so.
  I’m looking to collaborate on with other front-end devs to help me in the learning process for programming. 
   How to reach me I am new to Git hub so for now just send me a comment when I commit some code.
